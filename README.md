## NetFlix Clone
This project is a full-stack Netflix clone developed with Next.js, utilizing MongoDB for database storage, NextAuth for authentication, and Redux Toolkit for state management. 
The application replicates the core features of Netflix, allowing users to browse a catalog of movies and TV shows, register an account, and enjoy a personalized streaming experience. 
The implementation of Next.js provides a robust and efficient front-end framework, 
while MongoDB ensures a scalable and flexible database solution. NextAuth streamlines user authentication seamlessly, and Redux Toolkit enhances state management 
for a smooth and responsive user interface
